## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
- User will be able to add, edit, skip, or remove RX.

### Weaknesses:
- User will only be able to select a limited # of RX from a list.

### Opportunities:
- There aren't many good looking RX websites or apps, creating a nice looking RX app can be very competitive. 
- most RX apps are cold-hearted/elegant looking, I went for a different approach which might attract people.
### Threats:
- There are other apps with the simillar idea competing for the same people.
